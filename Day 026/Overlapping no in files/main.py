""" Take a look inside file1.txt and file2.txt. They each contain a bunch of numbers, each number on a new line.

You are going to create a list called result which contains the numbers that are common in both files.

e.g. if file1.txt contained:

1
2
3
and file2.txt contained:

2
3
4
result = [2, 3] """
